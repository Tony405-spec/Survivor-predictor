# ***Titanic Survival Predictor***

A collaborative project implementing Kaggle’s *Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster* challenge.

**Focus areas**:

* **Data Science** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and development of predictive models to estimate passenger survival probabilities.
* **Web Development** → Design and deployment of a lightweight interface/API enabling user input of passenger attributes for real-time survival prediction.

This repository demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning workflow**—from data acquisition to model deployment—while showcasing effective cross-disciplinary collaboration and version control practices.
